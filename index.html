	<p>Hi, this is my page for a few things. I created it as a personal project to share a few things with anyone that wants (and to practice coding)! I'm going to
	upload cool pictures that I've taken over the years and cool academic/personal projects. This is also to help with the lifesaving courses
	and tutorials that I teach as part-time work. </a></p>




	<h2>About me</h2>

	<p>I am currently a graduate student at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">MILA</a> and <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/carrefour-actualite/nouvelles/luniversite-de-montreal-et-ses-ecoles-affiliees-hec-montreal-et-polytechnique-montreal-se">Université de Montreal</a>
	pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science under the supervision of <a href="https://www.emmafrejinger.org/">Emma Frejinger</a>. I'll be working on machine learning for operations and optimization research, to be better defined soon. 
	I'm currently an applied AI intern at the <a href="https://www.nbc.ca/">National Bank of Canada</a> working on advanced analytics and machine learning,.
	In my spare time, I like adventure sports, especially climbing and skiing, and play a few other sports to stay in shape. I've been traveling quite a bit in the last few years and have been working in those places.</a></p>

	<p> I graduated from <a href="https://reporter.mcgill.ca/mcgill-on-the-rise-in-pair-of-world-university-rankings/">McGill Univerity</a> with a B.Science in 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&ab_channel=CrashCourse">Computer Science</a>  in 2020. I was previously employed as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZihywtixUYo&ab_channel=DoS-DomainofScience">Physics</a>. 
	machine learning engineer intern at Quebec's Ministry of Health working on predicting patient outcome after a positive COVID-19 test. The goal of this project
	is to implement it and reduce hospitalizations in Quebec. I was also a Computational Physics Researcher at the <a href="https://rimuhc.ca">Research Institute</a> - McGill University Hospital Centers' Medical Physics Unit studying two things; 
	Using computer vision, we are trying to develop software that diagnose radio-therapies based on patient-specific tumour models based on microdosimetry principles. 
	The second thing I'm working on is using Convolutional Neural Networks to help with fast-dose predictions using Monte-Carlo search tree principles to dose radiation.</p>
